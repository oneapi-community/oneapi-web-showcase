The oneAPI Construction Kit is a framework to provide implementations of open standards, such as OpenCL and Vulkan, for a wide range of devices. The oneAPI Construction Kit can be used to build with the oneAPI Toolkit. The oneAPI Toolkit includes support for various open standards, such as OpenMP, SYCL, and DPC++. DPC++ is based on the SYCL programming model, which allows to write single-source C++ code that can target both CPUs and GPUs.
