Machinery like Biomedical Recording Instruments often are subject to wear-and-tear and hence this study on Remaining Useful Life (RUL) with NASA dataset on machines under the influence of even external factors influenced while in space can be an eye-opener to enhance the diagnosis accuracy by assisting maintenance using AI to ensure high precision of the biomedical instruments, especially in applications like telemedicine.
