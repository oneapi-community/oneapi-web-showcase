This project is motivated by the evolving importance of computer vision in deciphering human demographics and behaviors. Leveraging deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, offers promising avenues for accurately detecting gender and age from images. Our endeavor aims to explore the potential of these techniques in identifying subtle facial features indicative of gender and age groups. By addressing this task, we aim to contribute to the advancement of computer vision and facilitate practical applications such as targeted advertising and audience segmentation. Our curiosity to harness AI for understanding human attributes from visual data drives this project, with the ultimate goal of fostering more personalized and efficient technological solutions across various domains.
