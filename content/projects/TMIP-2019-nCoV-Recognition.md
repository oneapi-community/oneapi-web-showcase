We propose the use of Deep Neural Networks, as an initial experiment we
used ChexNeXt Pneumonia Detection Model as the baseline architecture
where we use transfer learning to detect pneumonia. Secondly we use
three different convolutional neural network architectures (ResNet50,
InceptionV3 and Inception-ResNetV2) for the detection of coronavirus
pneumonia infected patients using chest X-ray radiographs.
