Image classification is a significant task in the field of deep learning. However, deep learning models usually require substantial computational resources. To address this, this article introduces how to use Intel oneAPI tools, especially IntelÂ® AI Analytics Toolkit, to accelerate deep learning image classification tasks. We will build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to classify images.
