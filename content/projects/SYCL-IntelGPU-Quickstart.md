This project demonstrates a minimal setup for SYCL programming using Intelâ€™s oneAPI DPC++ compiler, avoiding the complexity (and error-prone / misconfigured) use of the provided CMake-based setups in Intel's official samples. The src directory contains the example programs, and the build directory is used for compiling and running them.
