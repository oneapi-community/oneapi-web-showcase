“Dwarf bench” is a collection of patterns that attempt to capture
performance characteristics of analytical queries. The idea is to extend
the taxonomy of computational patterns defined in the article “The
Landscape of Parallel Computing Research” published in 2006 to data
analytics in heterogeneous environments. Implementing basic structures
and algorithms once for multiple devices strives to find a balance
between performance and specific capabilities usage, and implementation
effort. We chose platform-agnostic tools to express our language of
patterns (OpenCL, SYCL).
